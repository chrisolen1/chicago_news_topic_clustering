# chicago_news_topic_clustering
A bit of textual unsupervised learning to better understand prevalent topics in ~30K articles broadly about Chicago, for my NLP final project.

Experimented with Latent Dirlichet Allocation and Latent Semantic Analysis (along with a ton of data cleaning) to see how many coherent topics I could extract from the corpus. Data were from the Professor and are hosted locally in .pkl format. 

Next steps could include applying an RNN for topic modeling using the documents associated with certain topics with high certainty per LDA as labels. I could probably also improve on my regex rules for strpping out useless features from the corpus. 

Included here are:

•My code as a .ipynb
•Summary deck as .pdf
